## 📖 About The Project

**Spooky Maze** is an AI-powered, web-based, point-and-click puzzle horror game. We challenged ourselves to create a heart-pounding psychological experience using minimal design and eerie ambiance, all within a browser. The game tests a simple question: **Can logic survive panic?**

You are an urban explorer trapped in the study of a vengeful alchemist, Master Valerius. With only one hour until the moon is at its zenith, you must solve his magnum opus and brew the "Elixir of Release." As time ticks by, his spiritual presence grows stronger, and the room itself turns against you. Fail, and your soul becomes the final ingredient.
